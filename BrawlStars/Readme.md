# Guide for the Brawl Stars Scripts
Describe how to use the inbuilt functions to calculate and summarize the trophies and why the functions are there.

## CalcPowerPoints.py
### up_to_level
To calculate the trophies when all stars reach the dedicated level.  
@param level: the dedicated level; the default value is 20.
### required_power_points
This is to calculate that if reaching the highest level, how many power points are required for each hero.

## CalcTrophies.py
### to_reach_current_rank
This is to calculate the trophies that if the stars reach their current ranks. 
This function is needed when the hero loses some trophies, but I want to know the maximal trophies.
